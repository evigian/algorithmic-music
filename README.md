# algorithmic-music

This repository was created for the course "Algorithmic Sound Structure & Composition" at the Department of Audio & Visual Arts of the Ionian University, taught by Prof. Zannos Ioannis. The purpose is to demonstrate current practices of digital sound synthesis and algorithmic creation of musical structures, that were taught during the course.

## Built with

This project was built using [FoxDot](https://foxdot.org/), an Python library which is used as a live coding environment, and the sound synthesis engine [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/). FoxDot creates an interactive programming environment scheduling musical events while it communicates with SuperCollider. Both FoxDot and SuperCollider are open-source and they provide detailed documentation along with examples.

## Prerequisites

It is necessary to install SuperCollider and FoxDot. It is recommended to install git as well.
